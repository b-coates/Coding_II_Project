## Deliverable Four Content:
Here is a link to a video of me summarizing my project progress and things I have learned to do in Python 3:


I am currently working on my final project on *replit*. So far I have made two games, Hangman and Tic-Tac-Toe. I am now working on my third, a Geopgraphy Trivia Quiz. My goal for Deliverable 4 was to complete two to three games and learn all the concepts required to code those programs. New concepts I learned specifically for these games include:
1. How to code Python on a chromebook (very confusing to figure out)
2. embedding if and for statements in variables
3. more on returns, codeacademy did not fully cover that
4. the slice function
5. random function

### Sample Code that demonstatrates the things above:
```
for char in word:
      if char in guesses:
        print(char)
      else:word = random.choice(bag_of_words)
  guesses = " "
  turns = 10
```
### Deliverable 4 Reflection:
Most of my progress in Deliverable 4 was me building three out of the five games I intend on building. My goal was to complete two to three games and I accomplished that on schedule with my learning plan. In order for me to stick to the plan, I need to finish my third game and code the fourth game. I have not decided what games to code, but that should be included in my timeline. 


## Deliverable Three Content:
Here is a link to a video of me summarizing my learning and teaching how to use dictionaries in Python 3:


I am currently learning new concepts on the *Learn Python 3* codecademy course and planning out my project, my goal for deliverable 3 was to complete sections 9 to 12 of the course and continue to be confident in programming languages upto this point, concepts I have learned so far include: 
1. Dictionaries
2. Files
3. Classes
4. (also code challenges II)
### Sample code that demonstrates these things: 
(refer also to video linked above)
```
key_to_check = "Landmark 81"
if key_to_check in building_heights:
  print(building_heights["Landmark 81"])
```
### Deliverable 3 Reflection: 
Most of Deliverable 3 for me was wrapping up my learning and deciding how to code my final project. My goal was to finish lessons 9 to 12 and I did that on schedule. In order for me to stick with the plan better, I need to stick to the planned timeline and work on my project's foundation and building the first section of it. I have begun to plan out my project and decided on a collection of games because one game on its own would not be a good enough display of what I learned. 

## Deliverable Two Content:
Here is a link to a video of me summarizing my learning and teaching how to use lists and counting lists in Python: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nhwcdDY1MGO8DlrSkzykKENO7m6B06AL/view](https://www.google.com). 

I am currently learning new concepts on the *Lean Python 3* codecademy course, my goal for deliverable 2 was to complete sections 5 to 8 of the course and continue to be confident in programming lessons uotp this point, Concepts I learned include: 
1. Functions
2. Python Code Challenges
3. Strings
4. Modules
### Sample code that demonstrates these things:
(refer to video linked above)

### Deliverable 2 Reflection
My goal for this deliverable was to complete lessons 5 through 8. I met this goal. In order for me to stay on schedule in the future, I need to continue to complete one lesson per class and finish anything else at home. My learning plan is the same still because I have stayed on schedule. 

## Deliverable One Content:
I am currently learning new concepts on the *Learn Python 3* codecademy course, my goal for deliverable 1 was to complete the first 4 sections of the course and be confident in programming with that. Concepts I learned include:
1. Basic Intro
2. Control Flow
3. Lists
4. Loops
### Sample code that demonstrates these things: 
(Am I ready for School?)
```
def ready_for_school(backpack, pencil_case):
  if (backpack == 'full' and pencil_case == 'full'):
    print ("I'm ready for school!")
```
### Deliverable 1 Reflection
Most of this was getting the very beginning and basics mastered. My goal for the deliverable was to complete the first 4 lessons, as defined in the Learning Plan. From this point forward, I need to complete one lesson each class to finish the course and still have time to program a final project.
