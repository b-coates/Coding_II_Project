## Deliverable Three Content
Here is a link to a video of me summarizing my learning and teaching how to use dictionaries in Python 3:


I am currently learning new concepts on the *Learn Python 3* codecademy course and planning out my project, my goal for deliverable 3 was to complete sections 9 to 12 of the course and continue to be confident in programming languages upto this point, concepts I have learned so far include: 
1. Dictionaries
2. Files
3. Classes
4. (also code challenges II)
### Sample code that demonstrates these things: 
(refer also to video linked above)
```
key_to_check = "Landmark 81"
if key_to_check in building_heights:
  print(building_heights["Landmark 81"])
```
### Deliverable 3 Reflection: 
Most of Deliverable 3 for me was wrapping up my learning and deciding how to code my final project. My goal was to finish lessons 9 to 12 and I did that on schedule. In order for me to stick with the plan better, I need to stick to the planned timeline and work on my project's foundation and building the first section of it. I have begun to plan out my project and decided on a collection of games because one game on its own would not be a good enough display of what I learned. 

## Deliverable Two Content
Here is a link to a video of me summarizing my learning and teaching how to use lists and counting lists in Python: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nhwcdDY1MGO8DlrSkzykKENO7m6B06AL/view](https://www.google.com). 

I am currently learning new concepts on the *Lean Python 3* codecademy course, my goal for deliverable 2 was to complete sections 5 to 8 of the course and continue to be confident in programming lessons uotp this point, Concepts I learned include: 
1. Functions
2. Python Code Challenges
3. Strings
4. Modules
### Sample code that demonstrates these things:
(refer to video linked above)

### Deliverable 2 Reflection
My goal for this deliverable was to complete lessons 5 through 8. I met this goal. In order for me to stay on schedule in the future, I need to continue to complete one lesson per class and finish anything else at home. My learning plan is the same still because I have stayed on schedule. 

## Deliverable One Content
I am currently learning new concepts on the *Learn Python 3* codecademy course, my goal for deliverable 1 was to complete the first 4 sections of the course and be confident in programming with that. Concepts I learned include:
1. Basic Intro
2. Control Flow
3. Lists
4. Loops
### Sample code that demonstrates these things: 
(Am I ready for School?)
```
def ready_for_school(backpack, pencil_case):
  if (backpack == 'full' and pencil_case == 'full'):
    print ("I'm ready for school!")
```
### Deliverable 1 Reflection
Most of this was getting the very beginning and basics mastered. My goal for the deliverable was to complete the first 4 lessons, as defined in the Learning Plan. From this point forward, I need to complete one lesson each class to finish the course and still have time to program a final project.
