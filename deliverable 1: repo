The goal of this deliverable was to complete the first 4 lessons offered in codeacademy. 
They took longer than I expected, so I only made it through 3 lessons. In order to stay on 
schedule for the future, I need to dedicate mroe time outside of school, maybe 25 minutes 
per class. 

Overview of Learning:
So far in my codeacademy learning, I covered basics like adding and subtracting, variables, 
and user input in the first lesson. Here is some sample code: 

customer_one_tax = customer_one_total * sales_tax
customer_one_total +=customer_one_tax
print("Customer One Items: ")

In lesson 2, I learned how to use boolean variables and expression, as well as if, eilf, and 
else statements. Here is some sample code of that:

if planet == 1:
  print("Venus gravity: 0.91")
elif planet == 2:
  print("Mars gravity: 0.38")
  
In lesson 3, I learned mostly how to use lists and formatting them. That includes adding and 
removing elements, generaing lists, finding the length, and sorting lists. Here is some sample 
code: 

gradebook = [["physics", 98], ["calculus", 97], ["poetry", 85], ["history", 88]]
print(gradebook)
gradebook.append(["computer science", 100])
gradebook.append(["visual arts", 93])

In lesson 4, it covers
